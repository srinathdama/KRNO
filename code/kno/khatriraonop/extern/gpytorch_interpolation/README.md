# GPyTorch Interpolation
This module contains a copy of the [GPyTorch](https://gpytorch.ai/) [1] "interpolation" and "broadcasting" modules. Only the interpolation module is used by csinfdim.

The reason for including this module in the extern folder is to prevent any potential dependency issues in the future.
